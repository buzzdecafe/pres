#Pointless Presentations

... done with deck.js.

Included so far:
* [Scheme in about 10 lines of Javascript](https://rawgithub.com/buzzdecafe/pres/master/fp5.html): A completely impractical use of your time
* [Functors and Applicatives ... in JavaScript?](https://rawgithub.com/buzzdecafe/pres/master/algebra.html): But why? Hell, why not?
